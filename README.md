# Valentines-2026
Valentine's Day Proposal
Started off as PacMan theme it was literally a yellow circle and an orange, red, blue, pink square.
was able to get the squares to look like ghosts and Pacman's mouth to chomp and move in the direction it was going
changed the sprit to kirby and added eyes to the ghost with the pupils following the direction of the ghost
ugh too much to type enjoy
